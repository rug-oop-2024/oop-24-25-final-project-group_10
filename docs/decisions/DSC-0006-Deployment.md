# DSC-0005: Layout of Deployment page
# Date: 2024-11-09
# Decision: keep the layout of the modelling page for consictency and let the user only implement data based on what the model was trained on or let them create their own custom data for quick analyzation
# Status: Implemented
# Reason: easy understanding of what is happening and overseable code with it being divided up in parts
# Alternatives: Let the user search through and find their own items based on their data and code it as an actual page without functions
