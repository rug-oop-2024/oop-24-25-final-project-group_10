# DSC-0005: Layout of Modelling page
# Date: 2024-11-02
# Decision: Split each individual part up into functions and make the user progress step by step through the questions of what they would want to use
# Status: Implemented
# Reason: easy understanding of what is happening and overseable code with it being divided up in parts
# Alternatives: Let the user search through and find their own items based on their data and code it as an actual page without functions
